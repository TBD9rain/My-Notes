# Regular Expression Pattern

A `<pattern>` consists of one or multiple `<branch>` separated by `\|`:
```
<pattern>   ::= <branch>
            OR <branch> \| <branch> \| <branch>
```
A `<pattern>` matches strings satisfying any one of the `<branch>`.
If a string matches more than one `<branch>`,
the first `<branch>` will be selected.

A `<branch>` consists of one or multiple `<concat>` separated by `\&`:
```
<branch>    ::= <concat>
            OR <concat> \& <concat> \& <concat>
```
A `<branch>` matches strings satisfying all the `<concat>`.

A `<concat>` consists of one or multiple adjacent `<piece>`:
```
<concat>    ::= <piece>
            OR <piece><piece><piece>
```
A `<concat>` matches the `<piece>` sequentially

A `<piece>` consist of an `<atom>` or an `<atom>` and a `<multi>`:
```
<piece> ::= <atom>
        OR <atom><multi>
```
A `<piece>` matches the `<atom>` one time or `<multi>` times.

A `<atom>` could be a `<ordinary-atom>` or a parenthetical `<pattern>`:
```
<atom>  ::= <ordinary-atom>
        OR \%(<pattern>\)
        OR \(<pattern>\)
        OR \z(<pattern>\)
```
A `<ordinary-atom>` matches a character in strings.
A `\%(<pattern>\)` is a normal `<pattern>`,
which could not be referenced.
A `\(<pattern>\)` could be referenced with `\n`,
by current regular expression,
where `n` is from 1 to 9.
A `\z(<pattern>\)` could be *externally* referenced with `\zn`
by future regular expression,
where `n` is from 1 to 9.


# Pattern Search Commands

|`[<N>]/[/<offset>]`            |N      |search forward with the last `<pattern>` and new \<offset\>    |
|`[<N>]?<pattern>[?<offset>]`   |N      |search backward with `<pattern>` and go \<offset\> lines down  |

|`[<N>]*`                       |N      |search forward with the identifier nearest to cursor           |
|`[<N>]#`                       |N      |search backward with the identifier nearest to cursor          |

# Pattern Substitute Commands

```
:<range>s[ubstitute]/<pattern>/<string>/[<flag>]
```

Enter PS mode and substitute strings satisfying `<pattern>`
with `<string>` in `<range>` lines.
Replace operation is controlled by `<flag>`.

`<range>`:
`.`, current line;
`66`, line 66;
`78,+5`, line 78 to line 83;
`%` or `1,$`, whole file;
`<pattern 1>,<pattern 2>`, string satisfying \<pattern 1>\ to string satisfying \<pattern 2>\;
default, selected area or current line.

`<flag>`:
g, all matches in the same line, otherwise only the first match will be substituted;
c, need manual confirmation for each substitute;
i, ignore case for `<pattern>`;
I, don't ignore case for `<pattern>`.

Instead of `/`, other characters cloud be used as delimiter pattern substitute command.
EXCEPT alphanumeric characters, `\`, `"`, `|`, or `#`(for Vim9).

```
:<range>s[ubstitute] [<flag>]
```
or
```
:<range>&[&] [<flag>]
```

Repeat last substitute command with new [flag].
